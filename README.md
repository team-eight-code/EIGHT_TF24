# VALCUN-Intelligent Code Vulnerability Detection Chatbot


This project is an intelligent chatbot interface designed to identify potential security vulnerabilities in code written in multiple programming languages. Utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM), the chatbot provides accurate and effective vulnerability detection along with corresponding fixes, making it a powerful tool for developers and security teams.

## Features:
- **Multi-language Support**: Accepts code in various programming languages.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Utilizes an advanced LLM to scan and detect security issues in real-time.
- **Suggested Fixes**: Provides recommended fixes for any vulnerabilities detected.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and responsive frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend Powered by Flask**: Flask framework handles the backend operations, connecting the chatbot to the LLM.

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for a seamless user experience.
- **Backend**: Python (Flask) for routing and API management.
- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: Integration with Hugging Face API for code analysis and security vulnerability detection.
- **APIs**: GitHub API for scanning repositories and Hugging Face API for LLM-based analysis.
  
## Use Cases:
- **Software Developers**: Automated code review to catch vulnerabilities early.
- **Security Teams**: Efficient scanning of large codebases for security issues.
- **Startups and Businesses**: Enhances software security without requiring manual code inspection.

## Installation:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/team-eight-code/EIGHT_TF24.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project-directory
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
